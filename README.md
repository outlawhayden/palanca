## Hi! I'm Hayden - Welcome to My Art Page!
--------------
I'm a data scientist and mathematician out of New Orleans LA - I think that math and nature are incredibly closely linked, and my art is focused around discovering that connection.

Most here are done in a library called p5.js on top of javascript, or various flavors of python. Right now things are still in progress, but more exciting things are coming soon - check back in a few months!

If you're interested, give me a follow at @palanca.exe on instagram for more updates and posts there!
